### Description

This DPU allows executing HTTP requests (GET, POST methods) to web services and passes the response in form of file data unit.

This DPU targets to enable consuming web services, both. REST and SOAP.

For POST HTTP requests, there are 3 possible modes (type of sent data)
* multipart (form data)
* raw text data (content type can be specified: XML, JSON, ...)
