		<h1>DPU implementation tutorial</h1>		
		<div>This tutorial will guide you through the process of the new data processing unit (DPU) creation. But before you start
			coding there are few thing which deserve your attention.</div>
	
		<h2>Types of DPUs</h2>
        <div>The application distinguished three types of DPUs: 
        <ul>
            <li>Extractor (DpuType.EXTRACTOR) - DPU which extract data from some source. This DPU type has only outputs.</li>
            <li>Transformer (DpuType.TRANSFORMER) - DPU which transform input data into output data. This DPU has inputs as well as outputs.</li>
            <li>Loader (DpuType.LOADER) - DPU which save into DB/File/etc.. This DPU has only inputs. </li>
         </ul>   
        </div>
	
		<h2>Logging the DPU's activity</h2>
		<div>Every DPU should log extensively. To log in your DPU, use slf4j. 
			The log for each DPU is stored and accessible to the user by the graphical user interface of the application. 
			Using sl4j is simple. If you are not familiar with sl4j	the following example show the basics.<br/>
			<div class="code"> <pre> <code>
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class DPU_Template implements GraphicalExtractor {
	private Logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DPU_Template.class);
...
			</code> </pre> </div>
			Just remember to replace DPU_Template with your class's name. Then when you want to log something just call:<br/>
			<div class="code"><pre><code>logger.debug("Some message .. ");</code></pre></div>
		</div>
	
		<h2 id="secConfigurationConcept">Configuration concept</h2>
		<div>Each DPU has possibility to store configuration that can configure DPU execution. User can edit the configuration
			through the configuration dialog which is also provided by DPU implementation. You can store any serializable object into
			configuration.</div>
	
		<h2>DataUnit containers</h2>
		<div>Data between DPUs are passed in containers that are called DataUnit. The DataUnit from the programmer's point of view is an interface
			that in fact does not offer usable any functionality. For practical use more specific interface is provided. Currently only one interface 
			is available: <i>RDFDataRepository</i>. The DataUnit (ie. RDFDataRepository) can't be created directly. 
			To create DataUnit use DataUnitFactory, which is accessible via Context.</div>
		
		<h2>Context</h2>
		<div>Each DPU has execution context. It's main interface is ProcessingContext located in commons. The DPU itself (extractor/transformer/loader)
			uses more special type of Context ie. ExtractContext, TransformContext or LoadContext. 
			The context provide ability to send messages that are stored and accessible to the user. <br/>
			Context also manages access to the input/output DataUnits. The following example demonstrate this functionality for transformer: <br/>
			<div class="code"><pre><code>
<span class="comment">// get input DataUnits</span>
List&lt;DataUnit&gt;inputs = context.getInputs();
<span class="comment">// check if we have some inputs</span>
if (inputs.isEmpty()) {
	throw new TransformException("Missing inputs!");
}
<span class="comment">// use first input and ignore the rest</span>
DataUnit dataUnit = inputs.get(0);
<span class="comment">// cast input dataUnit to inputRepository, to check if we can cast we use 'instanceof'</span>
RDFDataRepository intputRepository = null;
if (dataUnit instanceof RDFDataRepository) {
	intputRepository = (RDFDataRepository) dataUnit;
} else {
	throw new TransformException("Wrong input type " + dataUnit.getType().toString() + " expected RDF.");
}
<span class="comment">// now, create output repository
// we have to specify type, in this case DataUnitType.RDF</span>
RDFDataRepository outputRepository = (RDFDataRepository) context.getDataUnitFactory().create(DataUnitType.RDF);
<span class="comment">// now we just check that we the object has been successfully created</span>
if (outputRepository == null) {
	throw new TransformException("DataUnitFactory returned null.");
}
			</code></pre></div>
		</div>
	
		<h2>DPU implementation</h2>
		<div>It the following sections we will go through the files prepared in the DPU template project, from which you may derive your DPU. 
			For each file we explain its purpose and list the mandatory and optionally changes that need to be done in order to implement DPU.</div>
        <div>For each DPU, you have to:
        <ul>
        	<li>adjust pom.xml containing basic metadata about the DPU</li>
        	<li>define the configuration dialog, which may be used by users of your DPU to set up the parameters of your DPU</li>
        	<li>implement the functionality of the DPU</li>
        </ul> </div>

		<h3>pom.xml</h3>
		<div>The pom.xml file contains Maven configuration. If you are not familiar with Maven then just ignore everything except of several lines containing "TODO". 
			TODOs have assigned number to make it easy to refer to them. In next few lines we go through all of them and give brief comment to each of them.
			<ul>
				<li><b>TODO 1. <span class="module_name">module_name</span>: </b>The Maven's artifact should be provided here. 
					Maven uses this name to identify the output jar file. For common usage you can just use name of your DPU. 
					This value should contains only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _ as whitespace. 
					This value also determines the name of the module's main class. </li>				
				<li><b>TODO 2. DPU name:</b> This value will be stored in manifest.mf file. 
					This name is presented to the user when your DPU is imported into the application.</li>
				<li><b>TODO 3. DPU version: </b> In most common scenarios you can leave the default value here. This value is stored in manifest.mf file as "version of DPU". 
					It correspond with Bundle-Version in manifest.mf. </li>
				<li><b>TODO 4. DPU description: </b> DPU's description is visible to the users. Provide all necessary information about your intended DPU usage here. 
					Provide contact details on the author of the DPU.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>DPU_Template.java</h3>
		<div>The DPU's main class. The name of the class and file must be the same as <span class="module_name">module_name</span>. 
			Thus, rename the file and class in it according to <span class="module_name">module_name</span>. One important thing is that the package for this class
			must be <b>module</b>. As in pom.xml the template file contains "TODOs", places which requires your attention:
			<ul>
				<li><b>TODO 1.</b> First of all we need to change the extended base class of the DPU. 
					The following super classes are available: 
					<ul>
						<li><b>AbstractExtractor</b> - Use if you implement new Extractor</li>
						<li><b>AbstractTransformer</b> - Use if you implement new Transformer </li>
						<li><b>AbstractLoader</b> - Use if you implement new Loader</li>
					</ul> 
					Each of these interfaces contains unique method that has to be implemented. We return to this later.</li>
				<li><b>TODO 2.</b> Here you should store default configuration of your DPU into configuration (the function parameter). 
				  	For more information about configuration please refer to <a href="#secConfigurationConcept">Configuration concept</a> section. <br/>
				  	The examples how to store integer and string to database are presented in the function. </li>
				<li><b>TODO 3.</b> Every DPU can have configuration dialog, that enable user to configure the DPU. In this method the DPU
				  	should create and return instance of this configuration dialog. <b>If you use gui.ConfigDialog class for your configuration
				  	dialog, you do not need to change default implementation here. </b></li>
				<li><b>TODO 4.</b> Based on implemented interface (selected in TODO 1.) you have to provide implementation
				  	of one corresponding method required by that interface:
				  	<ul>
				  		<li><b>public extract(ExtractContext context) throws ExtractException</b> for <b>GraphicalExtractor</b></li>				  			
				  		<li><b>public void transform(TransformContext context) throws TransformException</b> for <b>GraphicalTransformer</b></li>
				  		<li><b>public void load(LoadContext context) throws LoadException</b> for <b>GraphicalLoader</b></li>
				  	</ul> 
				  	In this method the functionality of the DPU should be implemented. All important data needed is passed to the method as Contex. 
				To get more information to the Context please refer to the Context section above.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
		<h3>ConfigDialog.java</h3>
		<div>This file contains implementation of DPU's configuration dialog. 
			The DPU's configuration dialog is implemented as a <a href="www.vaadin.com">Vaadin</a> component. To preserve compatibility with 
			DPU_Template.java default's implementation super class must not be changed.
			</div>
