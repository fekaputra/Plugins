### Description

Loads RDF data (graphs) into Virtuoso

### Configuration parameters

| Name | Description |
|:----|:----|
|**Virtuoso JDBC URL** | URL for establishing JDBC session with Virtuoso server |
|**Username** | Username for Virtuoso server |
|**Password** | Password for the username |
|**Clear destination graph before loading (checkbox)** | Self-descriptive |
|**Directory to load path** | Path to directory to be loaded |
|**Include subdirectories (checkbox)** | If checked, subdirectories are also loaded to Virtuoso |
|**File name pattern** | A pattern for file names to be included according to SQL standard (characters string is symbolized as ‘%’). For example ‘%.ttl’ |
|**Target Graph** | Target graph URI |
|**Update status interval (s)** | Time period between status updates (in seconds) |
|**Thread count** | Number of concurrently running processes |
|**Skip file on error (checkbox)** | Do not stop the pipeline when error occurs (if checked) |

### Inputs and outputs

|Name |Type | DataUnit | Description | Mandatory |
|:--------|:------:|:------:|:-------------|:---------------------:|
|config |i| RdfDataUnit | Dynamic DPU configuration, see Advanced configuration | |

This DPU has no input data unit. The input for this DPU (the RDF data itself) has to be specified in the configuration of this DPU as a directory on local disc. All files in this directory must be in the formats Virtuoso supports - the recommended formats are either application/rdf+xml or text/turtle (filenames suffix .rdf or .ttl repspectively). Pipeline designer has to move these files into that directory before the loader is executed. This can be achieved by using l-filesUpload with special ‘run after' edge to this DPU. This will make sure that loader will run only when the files have already been copied to the target directory. 


Sample pipeline design: e-sparqlEndpoint —> t-rdfToFiles -> l-filesUpload —-run after edge-—> l-filesToVirtuoso


### Advanced configuration

It is also possible to dynamically configure the DPU over its input `config` using RDF data.
