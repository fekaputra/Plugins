### Technical notes

* May be used instead of e-RdfFromSparql and also replaces DPU with the same name from Charles university.
* It requires certain libraries to be provided, see "provided" dependencies in pom.xml. This is something which should be improved in the future, so that everything is bundled in this DPU.
