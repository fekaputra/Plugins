E-SparqlEndpoint
----------

### Documentation

* see [Plugin Documentation](./doc/About.md)
* see [Plugin Documentation](./doc/About_sk.md) (in Slovak)

### Technical notes

* May be used instead of e-RdfFromSparql and also replaces DPU with the same name from Charles university.
* Since version 1.1.0, the artifactId (thus the name of the JAR bundle) was changed from e-sparqlEndpoint to uv-e-sparqlEndpoint. So if you run version of e-sparqlEndpoint prior to 1.1.0 and would like to upgrade to 1.1.0+, you have to either delete the previous DPU template and create new or manually upgrade the DPU and manually change the database (table dpu_templates) and folder with DPU templates (target/dpu).

### Version history
