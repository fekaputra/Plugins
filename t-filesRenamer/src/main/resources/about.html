List of useful commands with advanced mode unchecked:
<table border="1px">
    <tr>
        <th>Action (regular expression)</th>
        <th>Pattern</th>
        <th>Value to substitute</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Add a suffix ".gml"</td>
        <td>^(.+)$</td>
        <td>$1.gml</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rename file to "abc"</td>
        <td>^.+$</td>
        <td>abc</td>
    </tr>
</table>
If the advanced mode is checked, then the value to substitute is not used as a string but as an expression.
This enable utilization of SPARQL functions, but the result must be in form on string!
